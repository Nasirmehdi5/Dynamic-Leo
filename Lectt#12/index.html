     <h1> Nature </h1>
     <p>Nature is everything around us that is not made by humans, including trees, animals, rivers, mountains, and the sky. It provides us with fresh air, water, food, and a beautiful environment to live in. Nature is important because it keeps the Earth balanced and supports all living things. Plants give us oxygen, animals help maintain ecosystems, and the weather changes through natural cycles. Taking care of nature is important because pollution and deforestation can harm the planet. If we respect and protect nature, it will continue to provide for us and future generations.</p>
