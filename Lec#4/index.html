<p style="background-color: azure;"> (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.
    HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.
    HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.
    HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.
    There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.</p>
